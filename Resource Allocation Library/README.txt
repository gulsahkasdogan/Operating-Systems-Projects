-- type "make" to compile the library and programs

After the make, when you execute the file by ./app you need to wait a while for the program to complete if you want to see the result of the tests.

In additon to the wanted files in this project, we also have a test file which is named "book_example.c". In this file we have tested our library with the example from our course book in the safety algorithm section. 

Our app.c executes all three options and measures the time duration all methods take. It also tests the cost of deadlock detection.
